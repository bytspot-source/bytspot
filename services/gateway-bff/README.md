## API Docs (OpenAPI)

- Landing page: http://localhost:3001/docs (links to Redoc and Swagger UI)

- Live Redoc (served by BFF):
  - BFF Valet: http://localhost:3001/docs/bff-valet (spec at /openapi/bff-valet.yaml)
  - Upstream Valet (reference): http://localhost:3001/docs/upstream-valet (spec at /openapi/upstream-valet.yaml)


- Swagger UI (served by BFF):
  - BFF Valet: http://localhost:3001/swagger/bff-valet

- CI Artifacts:
  - GitHub Actions builds Redoc HTML for both specs and uploads an artifact named `openapi-docs` on each push/PR. Download from the workflow runâ€™s Artifacts section.

- Validation in CI:
  - @redocly/cli lint and swagger-cli validate both YAMLs; PRs will fail if specs break.
